## 🏗️ Project Overview

In the banking sector, "Core Banking Applications" (like Finacle or Flexcube) are often isolated from "Compliance & Risk Servers." Moving data between them for analysis usually requires expensive, proprietary tools that are slow and rigid.

**Secure Fin-ETL** is a custom-built Middleware designed to replace those expensive tools. It securely **Extracts** transaction logs, **Transforms** them into compliance-ready formats, and **Loads** them into our Fraud Detection Systems (iConcept4Pro).

## ⚡ Key Highlight: Parallel Data Migration Engine

The core innovation of this script is its ability to handle **Heterogeneous Parallel Migrations**.

Standard ETL tools often run sequentially. I engineered this bot to handle concurrent data streams from completely different database technologies simultaneously without locking the production database.

### How the Script Works
1.  **Multi-Source Ingestion:** The bot opens simultaneous connection pools to:
    * **Oracle DB** (Legacy Core Banking Data)
    * **MSSQL** (Card & ATM Transactions)
    * **MongoDB** (Unstructured App Logs)
    * **Flat Files** (CSV/Excel EOD Reports)
2.  **Asynchronous Processing:** Using Python's `multiprocessing` library, the script extracts data chunks from these sources in parallel threads.
3.  **Unified Transformation Layer:** Regardless of the source (SQL or NoSQL), data is normalized into a standard Python dictionary structure before being loaded into the destination.

> **Impact:** This reduced the "End of Day" (EOD) data migration window from **4 hours to 45 minutes**, allowing Compliance Officers to start their work earlier every morning.
